    <p><span class="highlight">Description:</span> In May 2023, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Paris, France. I took Engineering Communications with Professor D'Arcy Randall</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Experience:</span> It was my very first time traveling to Europe. I was able to visit places I had always dreamt of seeing, like the Eiffel Tower!</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Cost:</span> Best of all, I didn't have to take out a single loan or ask my parents for money. I was fortunate enough to attend on a "full ride" becuase of scholarships!</p>
